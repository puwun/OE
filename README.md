<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Toss and Choice: The game starts with a toss to decide who bats or bowls. The user chooses between even or odd.
*   Batting and Bowling: Based on the toss result the player either bats or bowls.
*   Runs: The user and the computer take turns to input the runs scored in each ball. The computer generates a random score for its turn.
*   Out: If the user's input matches the computer's score the player is declared out and the turn ends.
